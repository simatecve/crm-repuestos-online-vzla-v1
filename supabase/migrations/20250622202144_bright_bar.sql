  # Fix infinite recursion in user_profiles RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - Current policies create infinite recursion by querying user_profiles table within policies applied to user_profiles table
    - This happens when checking if user is admin by looking up their role in user_profiles

  2. Solution
    - Remove problematic policies that cause recursion
    - Create simpler policies that don't reference the same table
    - Use auth.uid() directly without role-based checks for basic access
    - Admins can be managed through application logic rather than database policies

  3. Changes
    - Drop existing recursive policies
    - Create new non-recursive policies
    - Ensure users can manage their own profiles
    - Allow authenticated users to view profiles (application will handle role restrictions)
